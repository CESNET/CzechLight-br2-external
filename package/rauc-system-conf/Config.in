	  Install a standardized system.conf RAUC config into /etc/rauc/system.conf

	  This standardized config supports two symmetric slots (A and B) for rootfs.
	  For both of these slots, there is another slot cfg for persistent data.

	  This package requires you to fill the names of devices for all four slots.
	  Based on them, the correct system.conf will be generated and installed.
