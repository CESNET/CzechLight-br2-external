      "message": "Perhaps there\u0027s some confusion in terminology. The watchdog timer has been started already by U-Boot, it\u0027s just that there\u0027s nothing which keeps resetting the timer anymore. In a normal boot, systemd will soon take over once instructed so via `enable-hw-watchdog.service`, but that service only gets started when there\u0027s been no problem.\n\nI\u0027ve rephrased this text a bit, but I do not want to add too many forward references to this text.",
