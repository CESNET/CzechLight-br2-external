Here, master has moved to v4-310-something, yet the latest build (which was based on a parent two commits behind) is marked as v4-309-g3038a7a. The comments in board/czechlight/common/os-release.sh say that this is a known issue because these merges done by Zuul are private, or transient; the actual merge commit that\u0027s built is not visible outside of the Zuul infrastructure.",
