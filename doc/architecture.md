# System Software Architecture of Czech Light Embedded Linux

These are important "features" or "design decisions" which drove the overall architecture:

- Users are supposed to only interact with these devices via YANG data.
If some functionality is not available through one of enabled models, that's a bug which should be (eventually) fixed.

- Devices are updated in one step.
There are no separate user-visible or individually updateable packages.
There's one software image which drives "the whole device".

- "Nobody" is expected to log in into the system.
SSH connections are supported, but users should not have a local shell.
Remote SSH connection should go to a CLI which manipulates the YANG datastores.

## Configuration

All configuration "should be" stored in sysrepo as YANG-formatted data.
Of course there are still (Q2 2020) exceptions:

- hostname
- timezone
- SSH keys for system accounts
- passwords for direct login, which should not be supported anyway
- ...

### Factory data

MAC addresses and some identification data and in future also calibration data.
As of 2020-04, MAC addresses and device type information (`czechlight=...`) are in U-Boot env.

## Boot Flow

### 1) Early boot:

- Hardware watchdog timer gets activated, and U-Boot starts pinging it.

- U-Boot: there's a [script that determines](../board/czechlight/clearfog/patches/u-boot/boot.patch) what [RAUC slot](https://rauc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic.html#target-slot-selection) to use.
This part is supposed to be immutable.
Nothing updates this script as it's hard-embedded into the bootloader, and nothing updates the bootloader in the field because *that* is hard to do in a failsafe manner.

- U-Boot [environment](https://elinux.org/U-boot_environment_variables_in_linux) is marked as "I'm trying to boot an A/B slot now" while keeping track of how many attaempts are remaining.

- Once an A/B boot slot is chosen, another [U-Boot script](../board/czechlight/clearfog/boot.scr.txt) (which is a part of every system release and therefore updateable) changes LED blinking patterns, loads the [device tree](https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference) (such as [this one](../board/czechlight/clearfog/sdn-roadm-line-clearfog.dts)) which provides Linux-level device description, and launches the kernel.

### 2) Linux Kernel:

- HW watchdog keeps running, but U-Boot has now ceased its periodic ping.
We have about 90 seconds to start pinging it, otherwise the system reboots once the watchdog fires.

- An [init shell script](../package/czechlight-cfg-fs/init-czechlight.sh) sets up `overlayfs` so that rootfs' `/etc` is writable, but all changes are discarded on reboot.

- Some parts of `/etc` are persistent ([sysrepo configuration in the `startup` datastore](../package/czechlight-cfg-fs/sysrepo-persistent-cfg.service), [SSH keys for NETCONF](../package/czechlight-cfg-fs/netopeer2-keystored-persistent-keys.service), [SSH keys for local shell](../package/czechlight-cfg-fs/openssh-persistent-keys.service)).
These are copied from `/cfg`, our R/W configuration partition, into their "final" destination.

- Bootup is controlled via systemd and its targets; it's a pretty stock configuration.

### 3) Useful services:

- Some LEDs are [set up from userspace](../package/czechlight-clearfog-leds/)

- The most important services are `sysrepo-plugind`, `netopeer2-server` which together provide a NETCONF server with a YANG data store, and `cla-sysrepod` which contains code that talks to the optical modules.

- There's also a web UI along with [a poor man's RESTCONF](../package/gammarus/) implementation that I'm ashamed of.
But hey, once there's a RESTCONF server for sysrepo, I'll use it, I swear!

- Once everything has started up properly (`Requires=multi-user.target` and `After=multi-user.target`), we [mark the current RAUC slot as functional](../package/czechlight-rauc/rauc-mark-good.service), and [instruct systemd to start pinging the HW watchdog](../package/czechlight-rauc/enable-hw-watchdog.service) as the last services to start.

The boot is driven by device information passed from U-Boot via the `czechlight=...` kernel command line parameter.

# Hacks and Development Access

## Root Access

Login as `root` over the serial console (ÂµUSB port at the front panel, serial emulation via an FTDI chip, 115'200 Baud).
On Linux, the command typically looks like `picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0`.
There's no password.

### SSH into the System

Unlike the NETCONF access which has its own SSH key store (but uses regular system-wide accounts for UIDs, etc), there's a separate "store" of SSH keys for direct shell access.
Put public keys into `/cfg/ssh-user-auth/$USERNAME` ([configured here](../package/czechlight-cfg-fs/czechlight-cfg-fs.mk)).

## Debugging, Installing Custom Software, Packages, Utilities, etc

There's no package manager, so it's impossible to install anything.
Buildroot always generates a full filesystem image that can be loaded to a device, for example [via RAUC](../README.md#Updates_via_RAUC).

### Development of on-device software

Buildroot supports [`local.mk` along with `*_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR`](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#_using_buildroot_during_development).
This is the mechanism that is used to select the specific version of our internal packages (e.g., `cla-sysrepo`) during the [build process via `dev-setup-git.sh`](../README.md#developer-workflow).
Either edit the `local.mk` to point, e.g., `CLA_SYSREPO_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR` to your `cla-sysrepo` checkout, or work in the checkout directly.

### Debugging

Sometimes `/tmp` could be useful for fast prototyping.
Here's how one could be debugging code on device:

```shell-session
user@laptop ~/build/br-cfb $ make cla-sysrepo-reconfigure
user@laptop ~/build/br-cfb $ scp per-package/cla-sysrepo/target/usr/bin/cla-sysrepod root@10.10.10.228:/tmp/
user@laptop ~/build/br-cfb $ ssh root@10.10.10.228 gdbserver :33666 /tmp/cla-sysrepod ...some args here...
user@laptop ~/build/br-cfb $ ./host/usr/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gdb -x staging/usr/share/buildroot/gdbinit \
  per-package/cla-sysrepo/target/usr/bin/cla-sysrepod --ex 'set sysroot target/' \
  --ex 'target remote 10.10.10.228:33666' --ex c
```

The core "NETCONF-related" packages are not stripped, so that some debugging should be possible.
